2019/01/22 Add a simple scheme for CaMKII. CaMKII can also bind CaMCa2, which makes it active, though less than CaMKIICaMCa4.
We  also added CKCaMCa2 binding calcium, I guess.
Simple scheme is adapted from the coarse grained model by Pepke et al. 2010.

2019/2/20 Bath application of dopamine (10 uM) cAMP in the CA1 pytramidal neurons 1.5x basal (Fig. 7). However, basal is 300 nM, which is super weird. Maximum is achieved for 3 min, dropps slightly afterwards. They do speculate about Gs, so I guess we'll stick to Gs and take striatal values.

2019/2/21 Add Avramas D1R reactions. Did not add PKAc phosphorylation of the D1 receptor.

2019/2/22 Go through BAR reactions. Rename R to BAR for clarity. Simplify the GasGTP dissociation from BAR and GaiGTP dissociation from ppppBAR -- there is no need for two reactions since NeuroRD accepts reactions with three products.

Add D1R desensitization by phosphorylation by PKAc.

2019/7/2 S831 should be roughly 25%, S845 10-15%. (Diering at el., 2016, PNAS)
