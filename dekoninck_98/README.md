De Koninck Paul, Schulman Howard, Sensitivity of CaM Kinase II to the Frequency of Ca 2 Oscillations, 1998

* Fig.1 experiment (Ca2+ oscilations) can't be directly replicated:
  * there were no information about what does it mean High/Low Ca2+ level
  
* This folder contains replication of Fig.2 experiment - CaMKII autophosphorylation due to CaM concentration:
  * tube experiment with immobilized CaMKII
  * Ca2+ 500 uM (constant)
  * CaMKII 100% phosphorilation at 5uM
  * CaM: 0.5nM - 1000 nM
